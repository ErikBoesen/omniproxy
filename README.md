OmniProxy
================
OmniProxy is an extension for Google Chrome that uses/modifies web services to act as proxies for accessing blocked internet content. OmniProxy supports using services like Google Web Cache, Anonymouse, ProxyWeb, Hide.me, and more as proxies.

Simply type 'omni' in Chrome's search bar, then a space, then the URL you want to view. If OmniProxy makes using the websites you visit difficult or impossible, you can switch to a different proxy in Options. (This shouldn't happen, but just in case, we've got your back.)
