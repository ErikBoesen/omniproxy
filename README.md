OmniProxy is a extension for Google Chrome that modifies Google Translate (or other services) to act as a web proxy. Google Translate is known for functioning as a [makeshift proxy server](http://www.itworld.com/consumerization-it/365373/bypass-blocked-webpages-and-paywalls-google-your-proxy-server), but OmniProxy takes it to the next level by integrating Google Translate into Chrome's Omnibar. In addition, other services are available to use if Google Translate is unavailable.

Simply type 'omni' in the URL bar (Omnibar), then a space, and type in the URL you want to view. OmniProxy will then open the URL in the selected proxy in a new tab, while modifying the appearance to remove all Google Translate buttons and menus (making the only thing visible the actual external web page).

OmniProxy does modify the non-proxy functionality of the site you use as a proxy, so if you have problems you should temporarily disable OmniProxy.
