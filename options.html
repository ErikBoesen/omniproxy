			<h2>Choosing a proxy</h2>
			<p>
				<em>You can change the proxy that OmniProxy uses if one does not work or has unintentional side effects.</em>
			</p>
			<p><b><a href="http://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a>:</b> This is the best option for most people, it works on the most networks but can have errors on some web page layouts. This is the default selection. OmniProxy automatically hides its language bar.</p>
			<p><b>Google Modules:</b> This is part of the discontinued iGoogle service and works the best (and even allows you to download files), but may be blocked on some networks.</p>
			<p><b>Google Web Cache:</b> This is the cache used for Google Search. Not available for all sites, and content can be anywhere from a few hours to a few days old. OmniProxy hides Web Cache's info bar.</p>
			<p><b><a href="http://anonymouse.org/anonwww.html">Anonymouse</a>:</b> This is a web-based proxy designed to anonymously browse the internet.</p>
			<p><b><a href="http://www.proxyweb.net/">ProxyWeb</a>:</b> This is another web-based proxy. OmniProxy automatically hides its popup advertisements and options bar.</p>

			<h2>How to use</h2>
			<p>Simply type 'omni' in Chrome's search bar, then a space, and type in the URL you want to view. OmniProxy will then open the URL in the selected proxy in the current tab.</p>
			<p>In some cases, OmniProxy modifies the functionality of the site you use as a proxy. If you have problems using those sites normally you should temporarily disable OmniProxy.</p>
			<p>OmniProxy is open-source under the GPLv3 license <a href="https://github.com/corbindavenport/omniproxy">on GitHub</a>. You can browse the code, help fix bugs, or even make your own OmniProxy!</p>
