			<h2>Choosing a proxy</h2>
			<p><em>You can change the proxy that OmniProxy uses, if one does not work or has unintentional side effects.</em></p>
			<p><b>Google Translate:</b> This is the best option for most people, it works on the most networks but can have errors on some web page layouts. This is the default selection.</p>
			<p><b>Google Mobilizer:</b> This is a discontinued service by Google that renders web pages for simple web browsers. Pages are rendered with almost all CSS styling removed.</p>
