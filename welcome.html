			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p>Simply type 'omni' in Chrome's search bar, then a space, and type in the URL you want to view. OmniProxy will then open the URL in the selected proxy in the current tab.</p>
			<p>In some cases, OmniProxy modifies the functionality of the site you use as a proxy. If you have problems using those sites normally you should temporarily disable OmniProxy.</p>
			<p>It's easy to change the proxy OmniProxy uses. Just go to the Settings to switch between all available proxies.</p>
